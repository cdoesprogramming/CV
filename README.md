## Camilla Greene  

I am a passionate and ambitious Full Stack Software Developer and recent graduate of Makers Academy. Following a successful and impactful eight year journey as a teacher, where I progressed to middle management with responsibility for the training and mentoring of newly qualified teachers, I am now eager to conquer a new challenge. The emphasis on personal growth, learning new skills, creativity and flexibility are a few of the many things that excite me about a career as a developer. 

Throughout my studies at Makers Academy I have opened myself up to learning a wide range of skills and languages all whilst focusing on best practice such as writing clean, readable and changeable code and Test Driven Development.

This results driven target enabled me to gather data on my cohort, assess and analyze the projected outcomes, putt together a plan of action implemented by staff within my programme and drive forward results within a strict time period. This resulted in my program receiving its highest recorded results and demand from students skyrocketing.
